Exercise 3

Object Equality

Description:
    1. Use Constructor Function pattern to create an Address object with next properties:
        street
        city
        zipcode        

    2.  Create a Function called "areEqual", this function will have 2 paramerers
        address1 and address2. If every field in both addresses are equal will return true,
        if not will return false.

            function areEqual(address1, address2);
        
    3.  Create a Function called "areSame", this function will have 2 paramerers
        address1 and address2. If both addresses are pointing same object (both have the same reference in memory)
        return true, if not return false.

            function areSame(address1, address2);
